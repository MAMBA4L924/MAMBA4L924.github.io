Hi there, I'm Kuangzhi(Arell) Ge, an undergraguate student majoring in artificial intelligence at School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science[(EECS)](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, class of 2026. Presently, I'm working as a research intern at [National Engineering Research Center of Visual Technology](https://idm.pku.edu.cn/), HMI Lab, advised by Prof.[Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/). My current research interests primarily focus on multimodal learning, especially on Multimodal-LLMs, yet I am thrilled about delving into other areas within the realm of artificial intelligence.
